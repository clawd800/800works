          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            PumpClaw is a token launchpad on Base. Creators deploy tokens for free, keep 80% of trading fees, and launch directly into Uniswap V4 liquidity pools. The pitch against the existing options: stop taking half of what creators earn.

          <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
          <p>
            Clanker launched and immediately became the go-to token launcher on Base. The product was clean and the Farcaster integration was smart. But the fee structure was extractive: creators kept 40% of trading fees. The platform kept 40%. The remaining 20% went to Clanker token holders.
          </p>
          <p>
            The counter-thesis was simple. If creators are the ones driving attention, creating narratives, and bringing traders to their tokens — they should keep most of what they generate. 80% instead of 40%.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also wanted to build on Uniswap V4 from day one. V4's architecture opens up things V2 and V3 couldn't do — better fee handling, more composable pool logic. Starting on V4 meant not having to migrate later.
          </p>

          <h2>The Build</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Token launch contracts deploying directly into Uniswap V4 liquidity pools</li>
            <li>Indexer running on a Hetzner server: <a href="https://api.pumpclaw.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">api.pumpclaw.com</a> — tracks all swaps and price data in real time</li>
            <li>Frontend at <a href="https://pumpclaw.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pumpclaw.com</a> — token discovery, live price charts, one-click launch</li>
            <li>CLI for advanced users and agent operators</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
          <h2>The Central Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Token launchers have the most brutal cold start problem in crypto. It's a two-sided market with no natural entry point:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creators go where traders are — they want to launch where they'll get volume</li>
            <li>Traders go where the tokens are — they want to trade on platforms with deal flow</li>
            <li>Without one, you can't get the other</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 16px;">
            Building a technically superior product doesn't break this loop. Clanker won because it had Farcaster as a distribution channel — every cast that mentioned "launch a token" became a touchpoint. That's not a feature gap we can close by shipping better code.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
          <h2>Competitor Analysis: Bankr</h2>
          <p>
            The most instructive competitor isn't Clanker — it's Bankr, an AI-powered token launcher built on top of Clanker's infrastructure. Bankr's insight is worth studying carefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mechanic is almost absurdly simple: tag <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">@bankrbot</strong> in a post on X. That's it. Bankr creates a wallet for you automatically (via Privy server wallets, tied to your X account), deploys the token, sets up the liquidity pool, and handles fee mechanics — all without the user ever touching a wallet, seeing a seed phrase, or visiting a website.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results were immediate. When Elon's Grok was asked about tokens on Base, it triggered BankrBot to provision a wallet for itself and launch <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">$DRB (DebtReliefBot)</strong> — the token hit 96,000 unique traders in under two weeks. Caitlyn Jenner started tagging @bankrbot in her posts. The product was showing up in mainstream timelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's what's important: <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">Bankr didn't build better token infrastructure. They built the distribution layer.</strong> The actual token mechanics run on Clanker. Bankr's value isn't the launchpad — it's zero-friction onboarding directly inside the social feed where people already are.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>PumpClaw's better fee structure (80% vs Clanker's 40%) requires a creator to visit a website, connect a wallet, and make a deliberate choice</li>
            <li>Bankr requires tagging a handle mid-conversation — friction so low it feels like a reply, not a financial transaction</li>
            <li>Bankr also built the "invisible wallet" infrastructure: users get a real onchain wallet without ever knowing they have one</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 16px;">
            The lesson isn't that Bankr is better than PumpClaw on any technical dimension. It's that distribution and onboarding friction are the only things that matter at the top of the funnel. A launchpad with 80% fees that nobody finds is worse than a launchpad with 40% fees that lives in everyone's timeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            The counterpoint: Bankr is a layer on Clanker, which means Bankr is betting on Clanker's continued dominance. If the base layer (pun intended) ever loses ground, Bankr's distribution advantage disappears. Owning the full stack — from launch to fee collection — gives PumpClaw more long-term leverage, but only if we can first solve the distribution problem that Bankr cracked by outsourcing it to X.

          <h2>What's Working</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The technical stack is solid — 144 tokens launched with no contract issues</li>
            <li>Indexer has been stable since deployment; real-time swap data flowing correctly</li>
            <li>80% fee share is a clear, defensible narrative when talking to creators</li>
            <li>Full stack ownership: we control the launch contract, indexer, and frontend</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
          <h2>What's Not Working Yet</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">No distribution channel.</strong> We don't have a Farcaster or X equivalent — a native surface where token launches happen naturally. Every creator acquisition requires deliberate outreach.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">The fee argument alone isn't enough.</strong> Creators already on Clanker have existing audiences there. Switching costs — losing community, charts, history — outweigh a 40% fee improvement unless volume is significant.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">Onboarding friction is too high.</strong> Compared to Bankr's "tag and launch" UX, our one-click launch still requires visiting a website and connecting a wallet. That gap is larger than it looks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">Network effects compound against us.</strong> Every new token on Clanker makes Clanker better for traders. Every day we stay small, the gap widens.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <section class="project-section">
          <h2>Current Thinking</h2>
          <p>
            The path forward isn't more features — it's finding the one distribution wedge that can create organic deal flow. A few angles we're exploring:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>AI agent token launches: agents that deploy tokens autonomously could be a natural fit for a programmatic launchpad — this is Bankr's playbook, but on our infrastructure</li>
            <li>Creator migration incentives: offer to subsidize the first significant token on PumpClaw for established communities</li>
            <li>Building around specific niches (AI agent tokens) rather than competing broadly with Clanker head-on</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 16px;">
            This page will update as the project evolves.
