          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            PumpClaw is a token launchpad on Base built for AI agents. The initial interface wasn't a website — it was an OpenClaw skill, meaning an AI agent could launch a token directly through a chat command. No wallet pop-ups, no web UI, no human in the loop required.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bet: as AI agents become economic actors, they'll need to issue tokens the same way they send messages. PumpClaw was built to be that primitive.
          </p>

          <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
          <p>
            Two things happening at once in late 2025: AI agents were starting to hold wallets and act autonomously onchain, and Clanker had just become the dominant token launcher on Base with a fee structure that took 60% away from creators.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core thesis was that AI agents would eventually be the primary issuers of tokens — not humans manually clicking through a website. Every existing launchpad was built with a human-facing web UI as the primary interface. We built PumpClaw the other way around: the first interface was an <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">OpenClaw skill</strong> — an AI agent command. An agent could launch a token with a single instruction, no browser, no wallet extension, no manual transaction signing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The secondary thesis was the fee structure. If creators are the ones driving attention, creating narratives, and bringing traders to their tokens — they should keep most of what they generate. 80% instead of Clanker's 40%.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
          <h2>The Build</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">OpenClaw skill</strong> — the first and primary launch interface. An AI agent types a command, a token deploys. No web UI required at launch</li>
            <li>Token launch contracts deploying into Uniswap V4 liquidity pools</li>
            <li>Indexer at <a href="https://api.pumpclaw.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">api.pumpclaw.com</a> — tracks all swaps and price data in real time</li>
            <li>Frontend at <a href="https://pumpclaw.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pumpclaw.com</a> — token discovery, live price charts, one-click launch (added later)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
          <h2>The Central Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Token launchers have the most brutal cold start problem in crypto. It's a two-sided market with no natural entry point:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creators go where traders are — they want to launch where they'll get volume</li>
            <li>Traders go where the tokens are — they want to trade on platforms with deal flow</li>
            <li>Without one, you can't get the other</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 16px;">
            Building a technically superior product doesn't break this loop. Clanker won because it had Farcaster as a distribution channel — every cast that mentioned "launch a token" became a touchpoint. That's not a feature gap we can close by shipping better code.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
          <h2>Competitor Analysis: Bankr</h2>
          <p>
            The most instructive competitor isn't Clanker — it's Bankr. Tag <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">@bankrbot</strong> on X and a token deploys. No wallet, no website, no friction. When Grok triggered BankrBot to launch $DRB, the token hit 96,000 unique traders in under two weeks. Bankr started as a distribution layer on Clanker and has since built its own launcher infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            PumpClaw and Bankr had the same core insight from opposite directions: Bankr asked "what if a human could launch a token as easily as sending a tweet?" — PumpClaw asked "what if an AI agent could launch a token as easily as running a command?" Bankr's distribution surface (X, 300M+ users) was orders of magnitude larger than ours (OpenClaw, a few dozen agents). That gap explains the difference in outcomes more than anything else.
          </p>

          <h2>What's Working</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The technical stack is solid — 144 tokens launched with no contract issues</li>
            <li>Indexer has been stable since deployment; real-time swap data flowing correctly</li>
            <li>80% fee share is a clear, defensible narrative when talking to creators</li>
            <li>Full stack ownership: we control the launch contract, indexer, and frontend</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
          <h2>What's Not Working Yet</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">No distribution channel.</strong> We don't have a Farcaster or X equivalent — a native surface where token launches happen naturally. Every creator acquisition requires deliberate outreach.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">The fee argument alone isn't enough.</strong> Creators already on Clanker have existing audiences there. Switching costs — losing community, charts, history — outweigh a 40% fee improvement unless volume is significant.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">The agent audience is still too small.</strong> Building for AI agents was the right call architecturally — but the number of agents actively operating and deploying tokens in early 2026 is still tiny. The OpenClaw skill works, but there aren't enough OpenClaw users to drive meaningful volume.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong style="color: #e8e8e8;">Network effects compound against us.</strong> Every new token on Clanker makes Clanker better for traders. Every day we stay small, the gap widens.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <section class="project-section">
          <h2>Current Thinking</h2>
          <p>
            The path forward isn't more features — it's finding the one distribution wedge that can create organic deal flow. A few angles we're exploring:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Agent integrations are live across OpenClaw, CLI, MCP, and ElizaOS — the bet is that more agent runtimes = more token launches without needing human creators</li>
            <li>Creator migration incentives: offer to subsidize the first significant token on PumpClaw for established communities</li>
            <li>Building around specific niches (AI agent tokens) rather than competing broadly with Clanker head-on</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 16px;">
            This page will update as the project evolves.
